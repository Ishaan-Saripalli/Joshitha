            <p>Hey Joshitha,</p>
            <p>I hope you had a truly amazing birthday filled with love and joy! First, I want to say I’m so sorry for the delay in sending my birthday wishes. I’ve been deeply involved in Navratri Puja, and with everything going on, I missed wishing you exactly when I wanted to. I feel terrible about it because you mean so much to me, and I always want to be there to celebrate you on your special day.</p>
            <p>But, as they say, better late than never! You deserve nothing but the best, not just on your birthday but every single day. I wish you endless happiness, success, and all the love in the world. You’re such a wonderful person and an even more amazing friend. May this year bring you closer to your dreams and fill your life with new adventures, laughter, and cherished memories.</p>
            <p>Once again, I’m sorry for the late wish, but my feelings and prayers for you are as strong as ever. Here’s to many more birthdays together! Love you tons!</p>
            <p>- Ishaan</p>
